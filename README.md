# DattaBench

Open source benchmarking tool for all types of systems. Completely open and free for all. Feel free to copy/modify/whatever to the code. Please read our license for more details (MIT License).

Open to any and all contributions! All contributions must pass our code check-in checklist.

## Can currently test following systems

Nothing yet! Stay tuned. Targetting MySQL and Postgres first.

## What we test for

Nothing yet! Stay tuned. Targetting write/read throughput and latency first.

## Goals

1. Completely free and open source - no strings attached.
2. Be simple and easy to use - this mainly refers to the installs/builds/usage of DattaBench.
3. Primarily focused on popular databases and storage systems as of 2023.
4. This tool only tests performance of systems as of 2023. If we have enough interest, we may test other aspects of these systems (availability/consistency/security/etc).

## Motivation
Used whats out there in the industry (HammerDB, Sysbench, etc). But I didn't like the setup process and lack of UI/UX. Hoping to fix it here, and make it an industry norm. That way we can reliably test and compare different databases and storage systems. We could extend this to encompass compute nodes, and test computational speeds (might be useful for AI related systems).

## Code check-in / PR checklist
1. None yet, stay tuned!
